## Key Features

- Utilizes four pivot charts and four slicers for enhanced interactivity.

- Adopts a carefully selected color palette from coolers.com for a visually appealing design.

## Visualizations

1. **Sales Over Time Line Graph**
   - Displays the trend of sales over a specific period.

2. **Sales by Category Bar Graph**
